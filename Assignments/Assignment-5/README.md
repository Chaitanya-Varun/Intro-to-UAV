This assignment is aimed to 3d print the whole chasis of the toycar and its compliant spare parts. The .stl and .gcodes are attached here. <br>
FreeCAD is used in designing the models and CURA is used in generating the gcodes for the 3d printer. <br>
In and all, it takes about a day for replacing the toycar entirely with 3d-printing.
